                                        the behaviour is EDX:EAX where EDX stores the top 32 bits and EAX stores the bottom).
add	edx, ecx                        ;   add ecx to edx (ECX HAS NOT CHANGED! IMUL DOES NOT ALTER IT)

This seems to be a compiler optimisation for division.

The magic constant 0xc64b2279 is a precomputed value that allows integer division
to be performed using multiplication and bit shifts instead of the expensive division
instruction.

Division is slow (takes many CPU cycles), but multiplication and shifts are fast.
So instead of doing input รท divisor, the compiler does:

Multiply input by a carefully chosen "magic number"
Take the high bits of the 64-bit result
Apply shifts and corrections to handle rounding and negative numbers
Result equals input รท divisor, but computed much faster

It's like using 100 ร 0.25 instead of 100 รท 4 - different operation, same result.
The magic number is calculated so the math works out exactly right.

This optimization is commonly used by compilers when they detect division by a
constant, replacing the slow division with this faster sequence of operations.
